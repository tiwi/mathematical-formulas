# Mathematical Formulas in Ruby

## About
This is a small Sinatra project which demonstrates how do we evaluate mathematical formulas in Ruby. Application was created as a demo for presentation to Krak√≥w Ruby Users Group (KRUG). It shows two different approaches how to evaluate algebraic expressions. These approaches have been implemented as strategy classes. One of them is using Ruby's eval method. The other one is using [Dentaku](https://github.com/rubysolo/dentaku) gem.

## Prerequisites
The application was tested using Ruby 2.6.3. [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) gem is required.

## Usage
```
bundle exec shotgun
```
